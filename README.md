# DEVELOPMENT-OF-IOT-BASED-RODENT-GUARD-USING-ELECTRIC-SHOCK-TRAP-SYSTEM 🐭⚡

Arduino-based IoT project for rodent monitoring and control system.  
Developed as a Final Year Project at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM).

---

## 📖 Introduction
In human habitats, pests such as brown rats pose serious challenges due to habitat overlap, property damage, and disease transmission. Traditional pest control methods relying on pesticides cause harmful environmental effects (e.g., the DDT case).  

This project introduces an innovative **IoT-Based Rodent Guard with Electric Shock Trap System**, designed to manage rodent infestations sustainably, safely, and efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an **integrated automated smart rodent trap system** using IoT to detect and capture rodents.  
- Design a system that uses **Arduino commands to trigger a relay**, delivering a **timed electric shock**.  
- Provide **real-time notifications** and **continuous sensing** of rodent status via IoT.  

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
1. **Environmental Impact** – Traditional pest control methods harm ecosystems.  
2. **Health Risks** – Rodents spread diseases, damage property, and reproduce rapidly.  
3. **Sustainability** – Demand for greener and safer pest control solutions is increasing.
